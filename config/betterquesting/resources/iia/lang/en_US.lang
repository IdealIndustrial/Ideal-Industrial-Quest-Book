Then put logs (wood) onto it, from 1 to 5 blocks height. Position the charcoal pile igniter on top in the center. All sides including top have to be covered by dirt.
bq.quest.water_tank.desc=To build this, you have to place these blocks as a cube, but with an empty center block on the middle layer. This multiblock will work as a small source of water, but anyway, it should be enough for a few bronze coal boilers, if your home is not in a desert, of course, since WTS may conjure water out of the air, and its collection speed depends on the biome.
